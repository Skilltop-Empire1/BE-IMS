As a user, I want to be able to sign in to the IMS so that I can 
access the system's features and manage inventory.

When I enter my username and password in the respective fields on
 the sign in page and click on "Sign In" button as seen

Then the system verifies my credentials and grants me access to the
 IMS if they are correct.

If my credentials are incorrect, the system displays an error 
message indicating that the username or password is invalid.

It will prompt me to the “Forget password” page where I will be 
asked to reset my password by providing the email address used to sign-up

I will get an email notification with the new password/ computer 
generated password.

Once the new password is inputted, it will re-direct me to change my 
password.

If the new credentials provided is correct, I should will be directed
 to the “Home page

If user has no account or the system cannot recognize the email 
entered, user should be prompted/directed to sign up page on the right.
